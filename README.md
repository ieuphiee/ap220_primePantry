# ap220_primePantry
[Created on: 02/18] Implementation of subset sum problem using dynamic programming.

Given a dictionary of items and their (integer, positive-valued) item weights on the command line, identify whether or not there is a subset that could fill a Prime Pantry Box to exactly 100% and report which items are in the subset.

Example function call:

primePantryV2({“pepsi”:55,“detergent”:30, “chips”:25,     
               “cereal”:15}, 4, 100)
               
Desired output:

[“pepsi”, “detergent”, “cereal”]
